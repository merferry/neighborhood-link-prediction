  \caption{Overall impact of adjusting the hub limit $L_H$ from $2$ to $1024$ (in multiples of $2$), and to $\infty$, on the speedup and F1 score of predicted links (log scale), of neighbor-based link prediction methods, with the number of unobserved edges $E^U$ of $10^{-2}|E|$ and $0.1|E|$. Speedup is measured with respect to hub limit $L_H$ of $\infty$.\ignore{, using geometric mean of runtimes for link prediction using the LHub approach using all similarity scores given in Section \ref{sec:metrics}; while overall F1 score is obtained by taking the average.}}
