  \caption{Overall speedup of \textit{LHub} approach for link prediction, and its phases (obtaining edges with top-k scores per thread, and merging scores from each thread into a common scoreboard), with $10^{-2}|E|$ unobserved edges, with increasing number of threads (in multiples of 2). Increasing the number of threads causes the work in merging phase to increase, thus leading to a poor speedup.}
