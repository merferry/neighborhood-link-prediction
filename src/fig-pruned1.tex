  \caption{TODO. Runtime in seconds (log-scale), and precision of predicted links, in percentage (log-scale), of the best neighborhood-based link prediction method (considering both the precision and runtime), on batch sizes of $10^{-4}|E|$ to $0.1|E|$ for each graph in the dataset. None of the methods succeed in predicting ground-truth links for \textit{kmer\_V1r}, and for \textit{asia\_osm} and \textit{kmer\_A2a} on batch sizes of $10^{-4}|E|$ to $10^{-3}|E|$, and thus their results are not shown. Note that the numerical suffix added to the acronym of each link prediction method indicates the hub limit $L_H$ parameter setting.}
