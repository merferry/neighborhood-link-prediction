In an early survey \cite{lu2011link}, we noticed the low stability of individual link predictors and thus suggested ensemble learning as a powerful tool to integrate them. Ensemble learning is a popular method in machine learning, which constructs and integrates a number of individual predictors to achieve better algorithmic performance \cite{zhou2012ensemble}.

While we explore 2nd order neighbors in this report, our techniques can be extended to apply to 3rd or 4th order neighbors.

In the future, we want to explore optimizing quasi-local and global methods of similarity. What are tensor factorization algorithms? Note that local-neighborhood similarity based link prediction techniques can only predict links between vertices that are at a distance of 2 (only). For farther nodes, multiple application of local neighborhood scores may be done (or recursive scoring).
