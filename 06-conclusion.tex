Almost all obtained social network data is incomplete since only part of social information can be collected from social network platforms \cite{wang2014link}. Second, social networks are highly dynamic, which might lead the nodes and edges to appear or disappear in the future \cite{wang2014link}.
Link prediction aims to anticipate the probability of a future connection between two nodes in a given network based on their previous interactions and the network structure \cite{arrar2023comprehensive}.


In an early survey \cite{lu2011link}, we noticed the low stability of individual link predictors and thus suggested ensemble learning as a powerful tool to integrate them. Ensemble learning is a popular method in machine learning, which constructs and integrates a number of individual predictors to achieve better algorithmic performance \cite{zhou2012ensemble}.

While we explore 2nd order neighbors in this report, our techniques can be extended to apply to 3rd or 4th order neighbors.

\ignore{Can the algorithms scale to 3rd order neighbors? (is it relevant?)}

In the future, we want to explore optimizing quasi-local and global methods of similarity. What are tensor factorization algorithms? Note that local-neighborhood similarity based link prediction techniques can only predict links between vertices that are at a distance of 2 (only). For farther nodes, multiple application of local neighborhood scores may be done (or recursive scoring).

\ignore{What is the link prediction problem? Why is it similar to a compression/GAN problem? Understand the given network, and predict the missing links. Why it can never be 100\% precise, but precise enough?}

\ignore{Why the input is only 1 graph? Importance of learning from other similar graphs in the dataset (or from the subsets of the graph). Explainability --- why this is important --- thus the simple algorithms (they help with explainability).}

In recent years, the field of link prediction has witnessed a significant increase in research activities. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed for link prediction, encompassing similarity-based indices, dimensionality reduction based methods, machine learning techniques, and more \cite{arrar2023comprehensive}.
