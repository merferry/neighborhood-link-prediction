Heterogeneous networks with different types of nodes and links require different approaches to those used in homogeneous networks \cite{sun2012will}.

Low-Rank Approximation: This method simplifies the structure of the network to reduce its noise using the adjacency matrix A representation of the graph by solving the low-rank approximation problem \cite{kunegis2009learning}. Unfortunately, this technique is not practical for large matrices due to lack of numerical accuracy \cite{martinez2016survey}.

The authors report the complexity of various algorithms in terms of the number of nodes $n$, and the maximum degree of a vertex $k$ \cite{martinez2016survey}.

Link prediction algorithms have been used in evaluating and inferring network evolving mechanisms \cite{wang2012evaluating, zhang2015measuring, zhang2017uncovering}, testing the privacy-protection algorithms (as an attaching method) \cite{xian2021towards}, evaluating and designing network embedding algorithms \cite{dehghan2022evaluating, gu2021learning}, and so on.
