%% Short summary of the work to be presented in the article.
\begin{abstract}
Link prediction can help rectify inaccuracies in various graph algorithms, stemming from unaccounted-for or overlooked links within networks. However, many existing works use a baseline approach, which incurs unnecessary computational costs due to its high time complexity. Further, many studies focus on smaller graphs, which can lead to misleading conclusions. Here, we study the prediction of links using neighborhood-based similarity measures on large graphs. In particular, we improve upon the baseline approach (IBase), and propose a heuristic approach that additionally disregards large hubs (DLH), based on the idea that high-degree nodes contribute little similarity among their neighbors. On a server equipped with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, DLH is on average $1019\times$ faster than IBase, especially on web graphs and social networks, while maintaining similar prediction accuracy. Notably, DLH achieves a link prediction rate of $38.1M$ edges/s and improves performance by\ignore{at a rate of} $1.6\times$ for every doubling of threads.
\end{abstract}

% Link prediction aims to anticipate missing or future connections in a network using known interactions and structure, often employing similarity measures for their simplicity and computational efficiency. While many studies focus on smaller graphs, this report addresses the evaluation of algorithms on larger networks and introduces a heuristic for efficient computation. Additionally, the commonly used baseline approach, despite its simplicity, incurs unnecessary computational costs due to its high time complexity.

%% NOTES:
%% - Parallelization seems to be not efficient for small batch updates.
%% - Discuss about conflicting updates
%% - 


%% TODO:
%% - Scale up the size of the graphs
%% - Move experiments to a better server
%% - Include a weak- and strong- scalabiilty plot: run the expt from 2 to 128 threads
%% - overall space planning
%% - add a few lines on novelty of the paper.
%% - table comparison of related work
%% - Include a section on preliminaries that talks about the various algorithmic ideas (Louvain, Label Propagation)

%% Workplan:
%% - KK -- Read Introduction, Related Work,
%% - Dip Sankar -- Approach -- summarize the main algorithmic ideas,
%% - Subhajit -- Results -- Plots, scalability, Dataset, experiments, implementation details,
